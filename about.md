Many thanks for visiting my web page.


## This is who I am

I am Joan Vilà Cuñat,

> an organism that turns caffeine and pizza into scalable and reliable software.

Computer engineer assembled at FIB-UPC Barcelona and working as a Software Engineer.
This web page summarizes my career and tries to share and to remember me interesting topics about software through the blog.

I was born in 1994 and I grew up in a nice farmhouse located in the center of Catalonia. Since 2013 I'm based in Barcelona where I studied a bachelor in computer engineering discovering my passion for coding and computer science. Nowadays, I describe myself as a **full stack software engineer**.


## This is what I do

Since I was a child I've loved technology and computers. But when I went to the university, I discovered my passion for programming.
Now, I enjoy everything related to software development, cloud distributed architecture and security.

I keep learning new technologies every day in order to create new software to help me and others for the every-day life.

##### The topics which I feel comfortable with:

- Object oriented programming
- Prototype oriented programming
- Full Stack development - React Native, React.js, NodeJS, Python
- Building scalable and reliable cloud based architecture - AWS
- Lean and agile practices - Scrum Master experience
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery
- Product security

## Projects

###### AKA Open Source projects

I'm a big fan of the Open Source community and whenever I have time I build stuff on [github](https://github.com/joanvila).

#### [Aioredlock](https://github.com/joanvila/aioredlock)

The redlock algorithm is a distributed lock implementation for Redis.
There are many implementations of it in several languages. In this case, this is the asyncio compatible implementation for python 3.5+.

#### [nock-back-ci](https://github.com/joanvila/nock-back-ci)

As responsible developers, it is our duty to test our services with acceptance tests to simulate real traffic.
This tool enables running end to end tests in the continuous integration pipeline for continuous deployment environments in a painless way.

#### [raml-js-validator](https://github.com/joanvila/raml-js-validator)

Simple RAML 1.0 validator that reads a file containing an API definition and performs a query to each endpoint to check that the RAML matches the backend implementation.
It pretends to be a way to prevent the RAML file to be outdated by triggering an error when it doesn't mach with the API.
It can be used manually or in a CI environment in order to check the consistency on every build.
