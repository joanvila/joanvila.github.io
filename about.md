Many thanks for visiting my web page.


## This is who I am

I am Joan Vilà Cuñat,

> an organism that turns caffeine and pizza into software.

Computer engineer build at FIB-UPC Barcelona and working as a Software Engineer. This web page summarizes my career and tries to share and to remember me interesting topics about software through the blog.

I was born in 1994 and I grew up in a nice farmhouse located in the center of Catalonia. Since 2013 I'm based in Barcelona where I studied a bachelor in computer engineering. Meanwhile, I've been discovering my passion for coding and computer science and now, I try to describe myself as a **full stack software engineer**.


## This is what I do

Since I was a child I've loved technology and computers. But when I went to the university, I discovered my passion for programming. Now, I enjoy everything related to software development and security.

I keep learning new technologies every day in order to create new software to help me and others for the every-day life.

##### The topics which I feel comfortable with:

- Object oriented programming
- Prototype oriented programming
- Full Stack web development
- Agile methodologies
- Version control (git)
- Continuous integration environments
- Computer security
