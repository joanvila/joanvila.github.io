Some days ago, I was talking with a little girl relative of mine. She was explaining to me that she is learning computer things at school. Office tools are the current topic. I asked her which skills was she learning and it didn't surprise me that the response was the name of a well known privative tool used to write documents.

# What's wrong with this?

---

As you may think, there's nothing wrong on teaching these topics at school. I would say that it is useful for the kids. But looking deeply into it, maybe the way it is done is not the most appropriate.

The thing is that teaching the children on how to use a specific tool rather than the concepts, makes them dependent to the tool. Moreover, when the tool is privative, they are being submitted to it's owner willings.

Before continuing reading, if you are not sure what free software stands for, here is a quote taken from the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) website:

> Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the program.

So now, let's see point by point what's the situation I want to share:

## Submission to the tool

I still remember one of the first days in the university when a teacher told us:

> Here, you won't learn how to use the cool technologies you can find out there, we won't teach you how to use the tools you will find in the real world. Instead of that, you will learn the concepts behind. You will learn to learn.

At the beginning, I wasn't sure if this was going to be the best. Indeed, many of my colleagues, still think that this wasn't a good teaching methodology. However, for us, there is no problem at all when it comes to learning new tools and new programming languages these days.

#### What I'm trying to say

What I mean is that my sister will know how to write beautiful documents with that tool but she won't be able to extrapolate the concepts to another one. So for this reason, she will be always tied to the company that provides the document editor.

This means that in the future, she will need to pay the price they will ask, and what is more important, she will be working the way specified for the software. Not the way she wants.

## No equality between the children

Now that we have seen the first problem, we need to be aware about the the social consequences of it. For explaining it, I'm going to put an example:

Let's imagine that the teacher proposes the children to write a document explaining some topic. In this situation, there are three ways to write the document and to get the program to do so:

- Some children will be able to afford the license price of the software taught at class. Those will have no problems.
- The second ones, won't be able to afford the license but will have a relative in their family that can get them an illegal copy for free.
- On the other hand, the last ones that won't be able afford the software and don't have a relative who can get an illegal copy of it for free, will need to use a free tool (free for zero price in this case) which most likely will be free software and the document will be delivered to the teacher in an open format.

This shouldn't be the problem but the issue comes when the teacher (using the privative tool) will opens the document of the third child and it won't look as beautiful as the ones delivered by the first two children.

Why does this happen? Because the privative tool doesn't want anybody to use free software and they are abusing of the power and situation they have in society by blocking the other solutions.

As a consequence, the last group of children will not be able to have the same mark for the same work as the first two.

#### How to solve the problem

There should be no discussion on that all the children should have the same opportunities when it comes to education.

For this reason, the official way to deliver the documents should be an open format, readable for every document editor. Moreover, if the teacher uses a free software solution to put the marks, he or she will see all the documents with equal rights because the software won't act as an evil changing the documents made with certain tools.

# Advantages of free software in the education field

Being said that, free software provides more advantages in the education field. As the [GNU defines](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), there are four freedoms that a program must have to be free:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help the others.
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

As we can see, the first freedom gives the children the control of the programs and doesn't submit them to the willings of the owners of the program.

The second freedom is good for curious kids. The ones that are interested in technology and want to know how a program works. With this freedom, they will be able to study the source code and the teacher can help them to do so. Born programmers will be very grateful to be able to understand how the software works.

We've been saying that there must be equality between children, so the third freedom provides this right. Sharing is a good thing and when it comes to software it shouldn't be different.

# Conclusion

Children should be given the ability to choose which option fits better in each case. They should be taught the advantages and disadvantages of using a privative software against a free software solution instead of teaching them how to use only the privative ones.

Changing from free software to privative software is easy. However, changing from privative software to free software is difficult because the owners of the privative one don't want and will coerce the users to stay with them.

To finish the post, I would like to remark that privative software is NOT always evil. In many areas, this kind of software is useful and necessary. However, not in school.
