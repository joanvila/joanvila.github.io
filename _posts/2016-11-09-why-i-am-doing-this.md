Some years ago, when I started to get involved to the software world, learning new things and new programming languages was my main goal. I was some kind of curious *child* who was dreaming about working in one of the biggest companies in the world, programming with the coolest and newest languages in that every moment. By that time, I used to happily *code* C++ and some Java on my brand new Macbook Air which at that time was in my eyes, *the perfect tool to do so*.

Today, my perception of the world and software has changed. Although my main goal remains, other things have changed in many ways: from closed to open, from privative to open, from insecure to more secure, from vulnerable to less vulnerable. And the things that back in those days didn't matter to me like social development and free software, today are one of my greatest motivations.

# Some context
---

As it is shown in my self-marketing web pages AKA [About section](/about/) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanvilacunat), I grew up in a farm where I spent my childhood playing with rocks and sticks. I studied computer engineering in [FIB](http://www.fib.upc.edu) and now I am currently working as a software engineer at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net).

Moving to a big city such as Barcelona and to live away from my parents made of me a curious guy that liked to go out with friends, to learn new things, to be always upgraded to the latest technologies and to experiment a lot. On the other hand, this reason made of me a person who didn't care a lot about the social problems, privacy and security.

# Today
---

My vision today has changed in a way I didn't expect and what I want to achieve is to give information to other people which I would have found very useful some time ago. What I pretend is to talk and to debate about two main topics:

- **Software technologies and practices**
- **Free Software and Social Development**

The first topic has two objectives:
1. To provide me an archive of notes and tutorials to go back to them when I forget.
2. To give to other people interested on those topics a series of practices, opinions and tutorials I would have found very useful when I started tackling them.

On the other hand, the second point has the objective of giving opinion to **any person** no matter the knowledge about computer science he or she has about topics like **free software, internet privacy, security** and whatever it can come to my mind. In this particular case, I will do my best to write the articles in a way in which a person who uses the computer only as a user, can understand the concepts. I will try to support the opinions with objective data but they will be opinion articles in most of the cases.



## What now?

Being said that, the only think I'm missing to say is: **Happy coding and see you around!**
